Installation for "Estimation of the Diffusion COnstant from Intermittent Trajectories with Variable Position Uncertainties" MATLAB code.

Make sure both MATLAB and DIP Image are installed.
MATLAB can be found at http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/
DIP image can be found at http://www.diplib.org/

There are three sets of M files in this distribution.
1) DSim class files
2) Diffusion estimation files
3) Figure generation files

****************************
1) The DSim class file is:
DSim.m

**************************************
2) The Diffusion Estimation files are:
computeMLE.m
LLH_ObsI_recursive1D.m
LLH_recursive1D.m
LLH_recursiveND.m
recursiveFisher1D.m
waldInterval.m

***********************************
3) The figure generation files are:
InfoValsPlot.m
QuadraticApproximationPlot.m
Sample_Trajectory.m (requires DIP Image addon for MATLAB)
Trajectory_Sim.m
VarInfoPlot.m


****************** INSTALLATION ************************************
Put all of the files in 1) 2) and 3) into the same folder and add to the MATLAB path.

Run any of the figure generation files (3) to re-create the plots as seen in the manuscript.  NOTE:  Trajectory_Sim.m takes 8 hours to run on a modern (~2012) PC.
